# Ceevo - Accept payments and optimise working capital 

Ceevo provides payment processing for ecommerce shops.
As a member of the Net1 Group, we accept and process all current payment methods for your ecommerce shop with our own acquiring solution.

We combine the core capabilities of an acquirer with those of a payment service provider and the preliminary financing opportunities of a bank in order to optimise your working capital.

With the plentymarkets plugin you are able to use these paymethods: Creditcard, SEPA, Sofortbanking, iDeal
